# Clicky Game

Heroku: https://afternoon-depths-34147.herokuapp.com/

This application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicked on an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
